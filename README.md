SQLAgain is a Windows App to run a SQL-File using SQL*Plus in several DBs.

Just used it to recompile RMAN Packages after applying Oracle Release-Upgrade 19.27 - processed 57 DBs in less than 10 Minutes.

But it is also handy to plan the execution of a SQL-File in an upcoming Maintenance-Window and get the outcome by Mail. It uses the Windows Task Scheduler.
